"""
Student Gradebook Management Program

This Python program allows users to manage a gradebook with nested subject structures.
Users can add students, record grades across multiple categories, and calculate
class averages, individual grades, and top performers. All data is stored in nested dictionaries.

Features:
- Add/Remove students
- View all grades
- Calculate class average for a subject
- View a specific studentâ€™s grades
- Determine the top-performing student in a subject
- Compute overall average grade in a subject

Pseudocode for main structure:
1. Initialize gradebook with sample data
2. Show menu and prompt user for input
3. Use if/elif to call correct function
4. Functions manipulate gradebook as needed
5. Loop continues until user chooses to exit

Dictionary Structure:
{
  "StudentName": {
    "Subject": {
      "Subcategory": grade (int)
    }
  }
}
